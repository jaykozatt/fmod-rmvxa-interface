# FMOD Studio API interface for RPG Maker VX Ace
This is just an interface for FMOD Studio API, intended to be used within an RPG Maker VX Ace project. Initially developed for personal use within one of my gamedev projects.

# Setup
Installing is easy. Just insert the code under the "Materials" section within your project, and create (if it doesn't exist) a folder named "System" within the root of your project folder, where you must drop the "fmod.dll" and "fmodstudio.dll" provided by the FMOD Studio Webpage (http://www.fmod.com).

# Disclaimer
This code was written around November 2018 - February 2019, and therefore it might not be compatible with current FMOD Studio API versions. 

For this sole reason, the API files, for which this interface was coded, have been included within this repository for the sake of convinience.

I do <b>NOT</b> own the FMOD Studio API (namely "fmod.dll" and "fmodstudio.dll").
